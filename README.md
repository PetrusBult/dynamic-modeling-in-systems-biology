# Assignment dynamic-modeling-in-systems-biology
Julia version of the assignment for the MATLAB-based course of BioSB - Dynamic Modeling In Systems Biology (Fundamental). Given in December 2025.

The assignment solutions are in a notebook <code> assignment/assignment.ipynb </code>, or in the html file <code> assignment/assignment_solutions.html </code>. Most of the code for the assignment is in the module <code>SimODEs_BioSB</code>. This is done to keep this notebook as clean and minimalistic as possible. Many of the functions part of the module were already created by me for my own research - and copied over to this slimmed-down module for the assignment.
